# Dynamic-Clearing-of-Financial-Networks

This repository contains an implementation of the continous time version of the Fictitous Default Algorithm that is used to calculate which banks stay solvent and which banks default in a financial network when the network clearing takes place dynamically.

Additionally it contains several examples where the Fictitous Default Algorithm is applied.

The algorithm and the detailed examples are presented in Banerjee, Bernstein and Feinstein (2019) https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.02091.pdf.
